# Common Issues

Occasionally, keymaps may become unresponsive. This may occur if you use <kbd>Command (⌘)</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to quickly switch between apps before unlocking your mouse with <kbd>Option (⌥)</kbd>. If this occurs there are a couple of steps you can try.

1. Press <kbd>Option (⌥)</kbd> to release the mouse, and then press <kbd>Option (⌥)</kbd>  again to enable keymapping. You may have to do this a couple times to regain control
2. Use <kbd>Command (⌘)</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> to open the Keymapping Editor, and then close it again with <kbd>Command (⌘)</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>
3. If the above doesn't work, restart the app
4. If keymaps continue to become unresponsive, save your work in progress and restart your Mac

> __NOTE:__ When using shortcuts like <kbd>Command (⌘)</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to exit apps, the shortcut will not register with keymapping enabled. It may also result in unintended button presses if <kbd>Q</kbd> is mapped. Before quitting apps with shortcuts, you should therefore release your mouse and disable keymapping with <kbd>Option (⌥)</kbd>
