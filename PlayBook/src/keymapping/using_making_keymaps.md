# Using & Making Keymaps

Many apps and games already have full keymaps available on the Discord. For more info see [this article](./import_export_keymaps.md).

## Enabling Keymapping

Once you've finished importing or creating your keymap, toggle it on or off using `Option (⌥)`.

## Custom Keymapping

You can open and close the Keymapping Editor at any time with:
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Open/Close Keymapping Editor

__OR__

* `Command (⌘)-K`.

Once in the Keymapping Editor you can add a new button by clicking on the screen. A ring menu will appear around the cursor with several different button types. 

The following menu will describe each button type in clockwise order.

* Circle Button (◯)
    * Adds a single key binding. Useful for pressing buttons on the UI.
* Directional Pad Button
    * Adds directional joystick, where Up, Down, Left, and Right are bound to keys (by default WASD). Useful for movement joysticks.
* Directional Arrows Button
    * Adds a mouse area for mouse control. Useful for camera control.
* RB Button
    * Adds a single button bound to right mouse button (right click).
* LB Button
    * Adds a single button bound to left mouse button (left click).
* Mouse Button
    * Adds a single button bound to middle mouse button.

The key bound to each button can be changed by selecting the keymap and pressing the key you want to bind it to.

Keymap position can be changed by clicking and dragging a button to its desired position.

You can delete a selected button with:
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Delete selected element

    __OR__

* `Command (⌘)-Delete`

You can increase a selected button's size with:

* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Upsize selected element 

    __OR__

* `Command (⌘)-Up Arrow`

You can decrease a selected button's size with:
* Menu Bar > Keymapping > Downsize selected element 

    __OR__

* `Command (⌘)-Down Arrow`
