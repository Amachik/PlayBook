# Download & Install iOS .ipa files

.ipa files must be decrypted to install them with PlayCover. Quite often, the app you're looking for will already be decrypted.

## Downloading

There are many sources online for decrypted .ipa files. Listed below are some recommended ones as they can vary in quality, speed, and recentness.

### Suggested Sources:
1. [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/871829896492642387/918279999209996288)

    Decrypted .ipa files can be found in #decrypted-ipas channel. Popular .ipa files like Genshin Impact will be pinned. ~~You can also request for .ipa files to be decrypted.~~ (Currently unavailable)

    __NOTE:__ The PlayCover Discord does not condone piracy and, as a result, will NOT decrypt paid apps

2. [PlayCover Website](https://ipa.playcover.workers.dev/0:/)

    A web repository run by PlayCover developers containing already decrypted .ipa files from Discord

3. External Websites
    
    There are several external websites including:
    - <https://ipa.decrypt.day>
    - <https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore>

    __NOTE:__ As these sites are not run or moderated by PlayCover developers, we cannot verify the quality or safety of these downloads. Use at your own risk.

4. Decrypt Yourself

    You can decrypt your own .ipa files including of paid apps you've already bought using a Jailbroken iOS device. There are many guides on how to do this online.

    __NOTE:__ This will require some technical knowledge, will likely invalidate your warranty, and may permanently damage your device.

## Installing

Installing decrypted .ipa files is simple. Either drag and drop the .ipa file into the PlayCover window, or use the 'Add app' button to select the .ipa file in Finder.

If you run into issues installing, check that `Xcode Command Line Tools` are installed, see [this article](./DownloadPlayCover.md#installing) for more info.

Some apps like Genshin Impact will require further and more technical setup to get working. Currently there are only Genshin specific instructions available [here](./GenshinInstall.md), but these instructions may also work for other apps.

__NOTE:__ Not all apps are supported. If you run into issues you can ask for help on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rMv5qxGTGC).
